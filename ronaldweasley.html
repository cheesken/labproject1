    <p>So about Ronald Weasley... He is the son of the Weasley family. The Weasley family is not very rich but what they
        lack in wealth they make up for in compassion and humanity and kindness and courage and morals and while these
        things may not get food on the table, they are better to have on the longer run. Of course you also need money
        for the longer run to come because otherwise without food you're just gonna die in at most 2 months.
    </p>
    <p>
        We really went off on a different tangent there and we apologize for the same. We wish we could correct it but
        we don't have the budget for corrections. Anyway about Ron, he is good at chess and he eventually marries:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hermione Granger</li>
        <li>Hermione Granger</li>
        <li>Hermione Granger</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Well not three Hermiones because that's obviously not possible and there's no marry-divorce thing going on
        either (Well we don't know that to be honest but that is what is assumed). Oh good lord, we went off on a
        tangent again.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since we seem to not be able to talk about Ron without going off on a tangent, here is a
        <a href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Ronald_Weasley"> SOURCE</a> that does that better than us. They do
        it better not because they are better. They do it better because they have more budget
