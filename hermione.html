    <p>So about Hermione Grange.... well what can we say except that she is the freakin QUEEN of the wizard world. Born
        to two muggles, this girl is not only a wizard but a really good one at that. Whenever someone asks "Is she
        hardworking" or "Is she talented" or "Is she beautiful" or "Is she smart" or "Is she the true hero of the book
        series", the answer is always
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>YES</li>
        <li>YES</li>
        <li>YES</li>
    </ul>

    <p> Hermione is everything that all girls should be and for more information

        Also, don't slack off of clicking that button and reading that article!! We might not have the budget for
        writers but there are sources out there that have the budget and we have put money from our own pocket to find
        those sources and put them in this website so that unlucky people who stumble on this low-budget website for
        information have a place to go to for actual information!
    </p>
    <p>Yes you are welcome!</p>
