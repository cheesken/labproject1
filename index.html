    <h2>
        To the Harry Potter Main Characters Website
    </h2>
    <img src="hp.jpg" alt="Harry Potter Main Characters">
    <p>This website contains all the information on all the characters of Harry Potter. Well, actually, since there are
        772 characters in the whole Harry Potter series and many of these characters are only mentioned once or twice
        without us realising and some are mentioned without a name at all, this is going to be rather difficult.</p>
    <p>This is why we are only going to focus no the three main characters in the books:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Harry Potter</li>
        <li>Hermione Granger</li>
        <li>Ronald Weasley</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Now, I could tell you that this website contains all the information on these three characters but that would be
        a lie. Our writers became lazy and frankly we just don't have the budget for better writers. So this is what we
        have, and if thats not enough.... Oh boy do I have bad news for you! </p>
    <p>Just Kidding.... its not all bad because I have with me, a link to all the characters and their information to
        make up for a website that doesn't have it. Just click
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Harry_Potter_characters">here</a>
        or click the button below *evil Voldemort laughter*</p>
