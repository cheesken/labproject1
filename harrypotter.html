    <p>So about Harry Potter.... well he is the most famous wizard alive. Why? Because he is the only person who not
        only survived an attack from Voldemort but actually destroyed him. I mean, thats how it is introduced, but it is
        his mother who does that and Harry like the infant he was at the time just buckles up for a rough journey. He
        really is shown as the hero of the series and he is in his own rite because he is brave and courageous when it
        comes to defending his friends. But when it comes to fighting enemies and all that spectacular shezzale, the
        true hero is (and I am going to say this thrice)
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hermione Granger</li>
        <li>Hermione Granger</li>
        <li>Hermione Granger</li>
    </ul>

    <p>She is smart and talented and beautiful even while having two muggle parents. She is an inspiration just like the
        actress that portrayed her. This is obviously not to throw any mud on Harry, both Harry and the actor Daniel are
        great but we here on this website are supporters of the "Hermione >>>>>>>>>> everyone else" club. For more
